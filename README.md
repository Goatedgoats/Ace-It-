Ace It! is a productivity tool designed to enhance users' workflow by providing a range of features aimed at boosting efficiency and focus.

## How I built it
Ace It! was built using modern web development technologies for the frontend, ensuring a sleek and intuitive user interface. The customization features, search engine integration, and ambient noise generation were all implemented using frontend frameworks and libraries without the need for a backend infrastructure.
